# AGENT – nixos-mini host

`hosts/nixos-mini` defines the single NixOS host in this repo. The `configuration.nix` today is intentionally minimal: it imports `hardware-configuration.nix`, sets `networking.hostName` to `nixos-mini`, and pins `system.stateVersion` to `23.11`. The hardware file remains minimal as well (auto-generated by `nixos-generate-config`).

Goals:

- Keep the host bootstrap light while planning for future services (Syncthing, observability stack, etc.).
- Future updates should import shared modules from `modules/` once they exist so common logic is not duplicated.

Workflow reminders:

- Do not run `nixos-rebuild` or edit this configuration without confirmation; coordinate the command with whoever verifies the resulting system before deployment.
